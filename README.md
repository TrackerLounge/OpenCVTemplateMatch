# OpenCV Template Match
Explore OpenCV's matchTemplates() method, to find similar images in a scene image. Draw a bounding box around all matching images above a given threshold.
Experiment with rotating and scaling the template to find variations in the scene. Extract these matches and align them all so they share the same degree of rotation and can be compared side by side.
